# Repair Enzyme Analysis

This repository contains a comparative genomics project focused on
the identification and analysis of DNA repair enzymes in bacterial genomes.

The project integrates HMMER-based searches, genome annotation outputs,
and phylogenetic analysis to study DNA repair pathways across taxa.
